MILESTONE:4
Focus: API Endpoints
For each user story, create new API endpoints or use appropriate API endpoints from libraries
List of APIs integrated
List of APIs created 
Description of API endpoints. (As per the problem statement)
Submission of YAML  (for the APIs created by dev-team) (When submitting YAML file for API, make sure it is Swagger compatible)
Code for the APIs (implementation)
Deliverables:
Documentation of API’s in a Swagger-compatible YAML file.
Backend code of the implemented API’s
Note: YAML file must have all the error handling, User stories mapping and description of each API listed.

PEER EVALUATION QUESTIONS:

1. API Creation and integration (out of 15): 
Provide a detailed description of the APIs in the YAML file, ensuring all API's are clearly listed.
Explain how the developed API’s are linked with the user stories, specifying how each API helps to implement the different user stories provided in Milestone 1. If APIs (such as GenAI API’s) have been integrated to create new ones, describe their usage in the next section.

YAML contains all of the required API’s and they are mapped to all the user stories. Additionally , any integrated APIs from GenAI (created by dev-team) are clearly listed - 15, YAML has some required APIs and some user stories are implemented, and integrated and GenAI Api’s listed- 8, YAML has some required API, but it is not formatted properly and the user stories not implemented,  GenAI API’s not listed - 3, Absent - 0

2. Code for the APIs - Implementation (out of 20):
Provide the complete code for the APIs that have been implemented. 
Ensure that the  code is well commented and with proper error handling, validation and responses. The implementation should match the YAML and User stories.
Code for all APIs are present, well documented adheres the best practices (error handling, validation and responses), fully implements the user stories - 20, Code for all the APIs is according to YAML and user stories but best practices (error handling, validation and responses) not followed- 15, Code is incomplete, poorly formatted, lacks proper documentation, but according to User Stories - 10 Code is incomplete, poorly formatted, lacks proper documentation and failed to implement User Stories  - 5, Absent - 0
