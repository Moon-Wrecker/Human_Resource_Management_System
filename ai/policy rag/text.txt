Every employee is expected to read and understand this manual, as compliance with these policies ensures the company maintains a professional environment where all team members can thrive.

2. CODE OF CONDUCT
All employees are expected to conduct themselves with the highest standards of integrity, honesty, and professionalism. Any form of discrimination, harassment, or intimidation is strictly prohibited, and employees are required to treat their colleagues, clients, and partners with respect and dignity at all times. Confidential company information, trade secrets, and proprietary data must be protected both during and after employment. Employees are also required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest to management and to comply fully with all applicable laws, regulations, and company policies. The company expects employees to maintain transparency in all business dealings and uphold ethical behavior in every aspect of their work.

3. WORK HOURS AND ATTENDANCE
The standard workweek is Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., including a one-hour lunch break. Employees are expected to maintain punctuality and record attendance accurately. Consistent adherence to scheduled work hours is critical to ensure smooth operations and teamwork. Requests for flexible schedules, hybrid arrangements, or occasional remote work must be approved by direct supervisors. Employees must communicate unplanned absences or tardiness before the start of the workday. Habitual absenteeism or repeated tardiness may lead to disciplinary measures. The company recognizes the importance of work-life balance and encourages employees to plan leaves responsibly while ensuring business continuity.

4. WORK FROM HOME (WFH) POLICY
The company supports flexible and remote work arrangements where job roles, performance, and business requirements allow. Employees working from home are expected to maintain a professional work environment that is quiet, safe, and free from distractions. Core business hours must be respected, and employees should remain responsive to communication through company-approved tools such as email, video conferencing, or messaging platforms. Data security remains a priority; employees must use company-provided or approved devices, ensure secure handling of confidential information, and adhere to IT security protocols, including VPN usage. Performance expectations remain unchanged, and employees are accountable for meeting deadlines, attending meetings, and maintaining productivity. The company may provide essential equipment such as laptops or headsets, while internet and utility expenses are typically the employee’s responsibility unless otherwise agreed. Work-from-home arrangements are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted based on business needs or performance metrics.

5. LEAVE POLICY
Employees are entitled to various leave benefits to promote well-being, work-life balance, and compliance with legal requirements. Full-time employees accrue annual leave at the rate of 1.5 days per month, totaling 18 days per year.
