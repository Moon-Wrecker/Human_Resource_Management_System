# Frontend for Team 11's SE Project for 25T3

The frontend for our project is made using Vite, using ReactJS as the framework, and Typescript. We have also use Shadcn's component library for our pages.

## Folder Structure

All the source code is written under the `src` folder.

Inside the `src` folder, there are multiple folders and files.

- The `assets` folder contains any images used in the project.
- The `components` folder contains both the `Shadcn's comonent library` and the custom components used in the project.
- The `pages` folder has all the pages to be used in the `routing part` of the frontend.
- The `main.tsx` is the start of the app.
- The `router.tsx` contains all the routing configuration.

## How to add a new page?

To add a new page, there are 2 things.

- Create a `tsx` file in the pages directory, that serves as the main file to be referenced for routing.
- Inside the `router.tsx` add the proper configuration for the app, to know which file to reference for which part.
